# Time Series

My name is Oscar Lopez, Iâ€™m a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp Program.

In this activity, I was task with testing many time-series tools learned in the past week to predict future movements in the value of Japanese Yen and the U.S. dollar.

I used the skills learned in class for Time Series Forecasting to decompose the Settle price using the Hodrick-Prescot Filter into trend and noise, forecasting returns using ARMA Model, forecasting Settle Price using the ARIMA Model, and forecasting volatility with GARCH.
I also used the skills for Linear Regression Forecasting to create returns and lagged returns and splitting the data into training and testing, fitting a Linear Regression Model, making predictions using the testing data, Out-of-Sample and In-Sample performances.

In this assignment, I used class exercises and activities to complete both start codes to overcome the small challenges I had.
